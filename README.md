# Apres-Ski Finder ✨

This project is a full-stack web application that helps users discover après-ski locations in popular ski resorts. Users can create an account, log in securely, and navigate through countries and resorts to view real-time data fetched from an external API via a custom backend. The application is built with a Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB for user management, and a clean vanilla JavaScript front-end.
